# GreatTundra
Created for the [Black and White Jam #7](https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam-7)

I will outline basic design elements for the game here and go through plans for the different elements.

## Overview

Great Tundra is a story of a boy navigating the great white expanse, the Great Tundra. The boy, name Nich, is from a small village on an island sound of the Great Tundra. After most of the warriors on his home island were slaughtered in war, he was the first baby born in two decades born to a surving warrior woman and farmer man. As their settlement is dying, his family sends him on a journey to appease the gods and bring hope to this future. Through his journey, he quickly learns there is something amiss in the Great Tundra, and the gods themselves need saving.

Due to the requirements of the Back and White Game Jam, this game will consist of only two colours, black and white (no gray at all). Gameplay will be in the style of a 2D platformer. Nich will wield a staff with a slight swirl of black and white to vaguely insinuate the idea of the north pole (at least in a media portrayal sense). In this version of the game, Nich will explore the Great Tundra with mountains in the north and coasts in the south. Nich will battle five gods in total, helping purify them in the process, but from what is only slowly revealed.

## Story

Nich travels to the Great Expanse in search of hope and future when he is unable to find one in his dying settlement. Armed only with a staff and combat training from his mother, he hopes to commune with the gods in hopes of a blessing. When first arriving to the tundra, there is but bleak atmosphere. Nich senses no hope in the air, and after chatting with an albatross on the shore, he learns that most gods have long stopped granting wishes and live without acknowledgement of mortals. Of all the gods, the albatross believes the Wise Fox may be willing to listen upon encouragement. 

The bird sends Nich on his way to the base of the mountain Noren, but he is blocked by a divine mechanism and is forced to move south to the dark grove Fracterra, where they navigate towards the Fox's den. Here they fight Ilagos who dashes along the ground and summons snow cannons. A symbol of a Koch snowflake appears before each of these attacks. When Nich bests the Ilagos in battle, the fox spirit is purified and appears in his white coat. He briefly chats with you and gifts Nich the magic of the snow cannon. Using this mechanism, Nich can activate the divine mechanism at the base of the mountain. Ilagos explains that some force has corrupted them, and while he cannot bring Nich the blessings he seeks, he believes the mother god at the top of the mountain may guide you.

After trekking up the mountain, Nich can activate a shortcut back to Noren's base. At the peak of the moutain, there is a cave that leads to Norsus, the mother god. Here Nich faces battle once again, except this time he'll need the help of his cannon to calm the god. On Norsus' face, a shield prevents any damage from occurring. If the shield is struck with a snow cannon, it weakens. After three strikes, the mask breaks and Nich can fight using his staff. After defeating Norsus, Norsus returns to normal and explains that a nefarious being has corrupted the minds of the gods. She claims an evil presence comes from the belly of this cave and that she was trying to protect the Great Tundra from it's presence. She, however, failed to stop the force that seems only to affect gods. She blesses you and mentions you could be the foretold child to save this land. She bids you forward.

When Nich arrive in Noren's Belly, Nich sees but a few landmarks, a locked door can has no way of opening, and a sign. When interacting with the sign, the floor beneath him suddenly cracks and collapses into dust sending him falling into the pit. After a long time, Nich falls to the bottom of the hole, which turns out to be the top of the hole. Instead he is now in the Southern Tundra. Here he meets the albatross from the beginning of the game suggests there are bound to be gods here as well and that you find them yourself. He mentions the god of dreams at least visits these coasts from time to time.

As Nich explores he finds another divine mechanism which he cannot pass and must explore the Avla Cliffs. Eventually, he is brought to the 
cliffside where here must fight Elda, the god of focus. Elda is a penguin-based god that shoots sharp projectiles at Nich, which appear after an Anitkoch snowflake symbol appears. After besting Elda, the god returns to normal and offers Nich knowledge about the blessings of the land the some of the prophecies mentioned by Norsus. She believes a prophecies states that a child will purify the rotting snow and protect the gods from malevolent forces. She gifts Nich the snowflake shuriken and urges him to seek out the dream god with haste.

As Nich is leaving the Avla Cliffs, he once again runs into the albatross, who cynically comments that Elda is always overlooked, but she is bright. The albatross wonders what kind of god requires the protection of a child. He does note that you do seem a remarkable child, so maybe there is some hope in Elda's optimism. The albatross introduces himself as Diome and bids Nich farewell.

Nich traverses the cliffs back to the divine mechanism casting the shuriken to open the path. From here, the Archis coast becomes available and Nich makes his way to the dream god, hoping finally for some answers. As he reaches the bay, he must fight the orca Bea, the dream god. Bea flies around the screen, but can only be damaged when lowered to the ground. She raises a fence of ice that only the shurikens can pass. When hit, she is staggered and Nich can attack with his staff. After finally besting Bea, she is purified and talks with Nich. She explains that the evil forces mentioned by Norsus is not a force found in either of these lands, but somewhere in between. She mentions the god of death knows how you could get there. As only mortal can travel there, she promises future blessings for your help and grants you additional strength until then.

Outside the bay, Diome awaits you, and upon talking to him mentions that Bea thinks you should travel to the Realm Between. To get there you will need needle fragments to open the Southern and Northern gates. He has summoned albatross around the Great Tundras to give these to Nich if he can find them. He must prove he is the prophetic child afterall. He opens the gates at the North and South pole. Before leaving, he then mentions that he is not the death god. He is but the god of endings. Mortals have come to call him this merely because for them, the end is often death. He mentions that he's come to like Nich and that he hopes that isn't the case for him.

Nich journeys back through Archis and the Avla Cliffs to find the three needle fragments for the South Pole. He enters a room off the South Pole and finds a Snowflake Compass. He inserts the three needle shards, and the compass rotates to point downwards. Nich travels back to the North Pole to collect needle shards and adds them to the norther Snowflake compass. The compass rotates and points north. An unlocking sound emits. After leaving the room, Diome is present and asks if you want to go to the Realm Between, and mentions this will be the beginning of the end.

Nich decides to travel to the Realm Between and face the foe that has plagues the Tundraic gods. Here the colours of reverse. Black is white and white is black. After reaching the end of a long corridor, the final battle begins with Idin, the god of impulse. Idin takes a form similar to Nich, but fights like Norsus and Bea. Shurikens must be used to break his initial defense, and cannonballs to break his armor. Aftewards, shurikens and staff alone can defeat Idin. Upon his defeat, the Realm Inbetween inverts colours, showing the purification of the realm. Idin talks to Nich telling him that there was no god to balance his power, and that with this defeat, he believes he has found someone to balance his power. 

Diome appears and begins speaking, talking about how perhaps the end for Nich and the prophecy is the birth of a new god to watch over the tundra and provide balance to Idin's desires. After acknowledging Nich's agreement, Diome releases an energy wave and the scene transitions to the start room, with the staff in the ground and hut in the background. As the flag flaps from the staff in the wind, the different gods are transitioned into the screen until finnaly coming back to the staff scene. In this final scene Diome is on the staff squinting in the wind. The credits roll.
