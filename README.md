# GreatTundra
Created for the [Black and White Jam #7](https://itch.io/jam/black-and-white-jam-7)

I will outline basic design elements for the game here and go through plans for the different elements.

## Overview

Great Tundra is a story of a boy navigating the great white expanse, the Great Tundra. The boy, name Nich, is from a small village on an island sound of the Great Tundra. After most of the warriors on his home island were slaughtered in war, he was the first baby born in two decades born to a surving warrior woman and farmer man. As their settlement is dying, his family sends him on a journey to appease the gods and bring hope to this future. Through his journey, he quickly learns there is something amiss in the Great Tundra, and the gods themselves need saving.
